Small reusable, modular and better code.
Reusable componenets

tssonfig

.ts - plain typescript files
.tsx - for react componeneets


Updating DOM is not made by react, it's done by react-dom

React Native - Platform agnostic, can build, Web, mobile and desktop 

A componenet does not return more than one lement

Fragment - to avoid the jugaad of having to erap multiple eemsnts inside a single div of a component

Hooks - Tells react that the value will change over time,hooks can only be called in a componenet function

Props - TO avoid Hardcoding

State v/s Props
Props - Immuatable, SImilar to function arguments
State - mutable, similar to lacal variables

Both will cause a re-render
